    <h1>LUCKY ONE</h1>
    <h2>Cosmosy</h2>
    <p>Rollin' the dice, betting on tonight
I don't gotta try, can you figure out
How I strategize taking what is mine?
Whiplash, left, right
Turning heads my way
I'ma dime, cash in, get paid
Maybe I might blow your mind (ooh-whoa)
Fireworks when you showed up
Wasn't ready for new love
Minding my own business riding solo-lo-lo
Thinking you was a player, chasing me like a racer
Got me spinning 'round, driving me crazy
Got me in a small red envelope
Bet you never thought you'd strike this gold
That I'm the la-la-la lucky one
Baby, the la-la-la lucky one
Like a genie, make your wish come true
Nobody can love you like I do
Boy, you the la-la-la lucky one
Baby, the la-la-la lucky one
La-la-la lucky one
La-la-la lucky one
Oh, bagged it like a million bucks
Oh my God, she pretty and tough
Hot on the market and everybody be crushing
Scratch card, we ballin', bet you feel lucky
Whiplash, left, right
Turning heads my way
I'ma dime, cash in, get paid
Maybe I might blow your mind (whoa)
Fireworks when you showed up
Wasn't ready for new love
Minding my own business riding solo-lo-lo

Chasing me like a racer
Got me spinning 'round, driving me crazy

Boy, you the la-la-la lucky one
Baby, the la-la-la lucky one
La-la-la lucky one
La-la-la lucky one
La-la-la lucky one
La-la-la lucky one
Got me in a small red envelope
Bet you never thought you'd strike this gold
That I'm the la-la-la lucky one
La-la-la-la lucky one
Like a genie, make your wish come true
Nobody can love you like I do
Boy, you the la-la-la lucky one
Boy, you the lucky one
La-la-la lucky one
Hah, eyelash, make a wish fast
La-la-la lucky one (lucky one)
